Oh hi!

I'm lazy by nature. I hate doing repetetive things. So I automate. You can find some things I've made easier for myself here. You can fork them or copy them and do what you like with them as well.

## About the site
So, I have learned a lot from the developers out there that put their hard work up for all to see and use. I wouldn't be where I am without their generous help. This is all about paying it forward.

A lot of what you will find here is SharePoint centric. Sometimes even very specific to whatever job I had when I made the repo. But there are other fun things too. I will add more when I have time.
