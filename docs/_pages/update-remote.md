[Update-Remote](https://github.com/kenhansen01/AdminPowershell/blob/master/Update-Remote.ps1)

## What's it do?
It points all the repos in a given location to a new remote location.

## But why?
I recently had to move an entire teams git repos from one TFS (Azure DevOps) Collection to another. In order to m inimize the pain of going through each and every local repo and changing the remote url, I wrote this little function.

## TFS? Seriously?
Just change the url and it works for any git based location!
