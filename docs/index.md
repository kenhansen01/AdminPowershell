[Admin Powershell](https://github.com/kenhansen01/AdminPowershell)

The Admin Powershell repo is a collection of powershell functions I use for various things.

### About this...
I am a SharePoint Architect (Solutions/Systems) who has a lot of different things to do. Sometimes I write a script or a little function that might be helpful for other people. Sometimes they are environment specific, but you can start here and tweak it for your own purposes.
